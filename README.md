# Bash script for configuring an Ubuntu development environment for flutter

Navigate to the directory where the bash file is located using the `cd` command.  
For example, if the file is in the `/home/your-user/scripts` folder, you can use the command:

```bash
cd /home/your-user/scripts
```

Grant full execution permission to the bash file using the chmod command with the +x option.
For example:


```bash
chmod +x setup-unbuntu.sh
```


This will allow the file to be executed by all users.

Now you can run the bash file by typing ./ followed by the file name.
For example:

```bash
./setup-unbuntu.sh
```
